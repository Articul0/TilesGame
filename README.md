# TilesGame

This is ColorTiles puzzle with canvas based interface

On the screen you see a field of 4x4 cells. 
Each cell can be light or dark in color. 
When you click on a cell, all cells located on the same horizontal and vertical lines change their color to the opposite. 
At the start of the game, the tiles are randomly colored (dark or light). The goal of the game is to match all the tiles to the same color.
